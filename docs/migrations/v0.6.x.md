# Migrate to version 0.6.x
While updating you software from version `0.5.x` to `0.6.x`, you will need to perform some required actions. 

## Validators
## Before export
Since there was a bug with `v0.5.1`, if you are running that version you first need to update to `v0.5.2` in order to properly export the state. You can do so by running: 

```shell
cd ~/desmos
git fetch --tags && git checkout tags/v0.5.2
make install
```

This should install `v0.5.2` on your node, allowing you to export the state properly.

## After export
Validators need to remember that they will have to execute the `migrate` command during a future chain upgrade. This will be also remembered inside the upgrade procedure guide. 

A part from this, a small change to the `genesis.json` file is required after executing the `migrate` command.

With `0.6.x` we've introduced back the `crisis` module. For this reason, you are required to edit the `app_state` JSON field by adding the following piece of JSON content **after the `bank` field**: 

```json
{
  "crisis": {
    "constant_fee": {
      "amount": "1000",
      "denom": "udaric"
    }
  }
}
```

This should be the resulting JSON:

```json
{
  "bank": {
    "send_enabled": true
  },
  "crisis": {
    "constant_fee": {
      "amount": "1000",
      "denom": "udaric"
    }
  }
}
```

Once you have done so, you should be able to start the chain properly.
