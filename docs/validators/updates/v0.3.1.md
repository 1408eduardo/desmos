# Version `0.3.1` update
The following guide explains how you can update your validator node from `v0.3.0` to `v0.3.1` seamlessly without loosing a single block validated in the process. 

## Phase 1 - Updating Desmos
1. Go into your Desmos code folder. If you didn't change the suggested folder path, it should be `~/desmos`: 
   ```shell
   cd ~/desmos
   ```
   
2. Fetch the changes and checkout tag `v0.3.1`: 
   ```shell
   git fetch -a
   git checkout tags/v0.3.1
   ```
   
3. Install the latest update:   
   ```shell
   make install
   ```
   
4. Verify the update has been installed properly:
   ```shell
   desmoscli version
   # Should ouput: 0.3.1
   
   desmosd version
   # Should ouput: 0.3.1
   ``` 
   
## Phase 2 - Update your node
In order to update your node all you have to do is simply stopping it and re-starting it.
  
If you are running it as a server, you can run the following commands: 
```shell
systemctl restart desmosd
``` 

In order to make sure everything worked properly, you can run the following: 

```shell
systemctl status desmosd
```
